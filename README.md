# UPF-RELATED-REPO
This repo gives information on UPF

### AFTER GOING THROUGH THIS REPO WE CAN DO FOLLOWING 
  ==> Describe and identify a power domain 

  
  ==> Describe what power strategies are

  
  ==> Describe how the supply network of a design can be built
      (Create a simple power domain based isolation or retention, or level-shifter strategy)

      
  ==> Use some of UPF power related commands 

## Introduction to UPF
  ==> Complexity of the UPF can no longer be understood unless it is seperated from a design itself

  ==>Power intent in these days are developed along with the functional intent of the design (Both built in parallel)

  ==>UPF represent power intent of the design across the flow (across simulation, verification and implementation)

### Advanced low power techniques
