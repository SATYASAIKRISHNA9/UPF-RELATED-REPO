# UPF-RELATED-REPO
This repo gives information on UPF

### AFTER GOING THROUGH THIS REPO WE CAN DO FOLLOWING 
  ==> Describe and identify a power domain 

  
  ==> Describe what power strategies are

  
  ==> Describe how the supply network of a design can be built
      (Create a simple power domain based isolation or retention, or level-shifter strategy)

      
  ==> Use some of UPF power related commands 

## Introduction to UPF
  ==> Complexity of the UPF can no longer be understood unless it is seperated from a design itself

  ==>Power intent in these days are developed along with the functional intent of the design (Both built in parallel)

  ==>UPF represent power intent of the design across the flow (across simulation, verification and implementation)

### Advanced low power techniques

Below image shows the multi-voltage design in where we reduce the voltage in lower performance blocks.

Below image shows that we cut off the power to some blocks which we do not need them for a certain time.
